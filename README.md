- Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy and mean squared error.
- Analyzing results and discussing the impact of hyperparameters and feature selection.

### Assignment 3
**Report:** [report_2021555.pdf](Assignment%203/report_2021555.pdf)  
**Summary:**  
Assignment 3 delves into more advanced topics, such as:
- Ensemble methods (Random Forests, Bagging, Boosting).
- Comparing the performance of different ensemble techniques.
- Working with complex datasets and handling overfitting.
- Visualizing feature importances and interpreting model decisions.

### Assignment 4
**Report:** [report_2021555.pdf](Assignment%204/report_2021555.pdf)  
**Summary:**  
Assignment 4 covers:
- Unsupervised learning techniques, including clustering (KMeans, hierarchical).
- Dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, t-SNE).
- Evaluating clustering results using internal and external metrics.
- Applying these techniques to real datasets, understanding their strengths and limitations.
